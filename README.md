# Darko JuriÄ‡
I am computer vision developer located in Zagreb, Croatia.  
The page provides basic info about myself (business and private info).  
For the full business profile please visit [my Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darko-juric/) page.

----------------------
## My short bio

I have been actively engaged in the field of machine learning since 2013, commencing my involvement through the development of algorithms for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and visual product quality inspection. Throughout the subsequent years, my focus transitioned to media compression development, dedicating efforts towards formulating a concept for expedited media encoding for advertising purposes. 

In the early months of 2021, I redirected my attention to machine learning, placing a particular emphasis on deep learning within the realm of computer vision. 
Notably, I even undertook the endeavor of constructing a condensed iteration of PyTorch entirely from scratch. 

Presently, my endeavors are centered around the creation of real-time deep learning applications for secure face recognition.
